    ABSTRACT = {The CRISPR (clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic repeats)-Cas
(CRISPR-associated genes) systems of archaea and bacteria provide adaptive
immunity against viruses and other selfish elements and are believed to curtail
horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Limiting acquisition of new genetic material
could be one of the sources of the fitness cost of CRISPR-Cas maintenance and one
of the causes of the patchy distribution of CRISPR-Cas among bacteria, and across
environments. We sought to test the hypothesis that the activity of CRISPR-Cas in
microbes is negatively correlated with the extent of recent HGT. Using three
independent measures of HGT, we found no significant dependence between the
length of CRISPR arrays, which reflects the activity of the immune system, and
the estimated number of recent HGT events. In contrast, we observed a significant
negative dependence between the estimated extent of HGT and growth temperature of
microbes, which could be explained by the lower genetic diversity in hotter
environments. We hypothesize that the relevant events in the evolution of
resistance to mobile elements and proclivity for HGT, to which CRISPR-Cas systems
seem to substantially contribute, occur on the population scale rather than on
the timescale of species evolution.The ISME Journal advance online publication,

    ABSTRACT = {Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) together with 
associated sequences (cas) form the CRISPR-Cas system, which provides adaptive
immunity against viruses and plasmids in bacteria and archaea. Immunity is built 
through acquisition of short stretches of invasive nucleic acids into CRISPR loci
as 'spacers'. These immune markers are transcribed and processed into small
noncoding interfering CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that guide Cas proteins toward target 
nucleic acids for specific cleavage of homologous sequences. Mechanistically,
CRISPR-Cas systems function in three distinct stages, namely: (1) adaptation,
where new spacers are acquired from invasive elements for immunization; (2) crRNA
biogenesis, where CRISPR loci are transcribed and processed into small
interfering crRNAs; and (3) interference, where crRNAs guide the Cas machinery to
specifically cleave homologous invasive nucleic acids. A number of studies have
shown that CRISPR-mediated immunity can readily increase the breadth and depth of
virus resistance in bacteria and archaea. CRISPR interference can also target
plasmid sequences and provide a barrier against the uptake of undesirable mobile 
genetic elements. These inheritable hypervariable loci provide phylogenetic
information that can be insightful for typing purposes, epidemiological studies, 
and ecological surveys of natural habitats and environmental samples. More
recently, the ability to reprogram CRISPR-directed endonuclease activity using
customizable small noncoding interfering RNAs has set the stage for novel genome 
editing and engineering avenues. This review highlights recent studies that
revealed the molecular basis of CRISPR-mediated immunity, and discusses
applications of crRNA-guided interference.},

    ABSTRACT = {The immune systems that protect organisms from infectious agents invariably have 
a cost for the host. In bacteria and archaea CRISPR-Cas loci can serve as
adaptive immune systems that protect these microbes from infectiously transmitted
DNAs. When those DNAs are borne by lytic viruses (phages), this protection can
provide a considerable advantage. CRISPR-Cas immunity can also prevent cells from
acquiring plasmids and free DNA bearing genes that increase their fitness. Here, 
we use a combination of experiments and mathematical-computer simulation models
to explore this downside of CRISPR-Cas immunity and its implications for the
maintenance of CRISPR-Cas loci in microbial populations. We analyzed the
conjugational transfer of the staphylococcal plasmid pG0400 into Staphylococcus
epidermidis RP62a recipients that bear a CRISPR-Cas locus targeting this plasmid.
Contrary to what is anticipated for lytic phages, which evade CRISPR by mutations
in the target region, the evasion of CRISPR immunity by plasmids occurs at the
level of the host through loss of functional CRISPR-Cas immunity. The results of 
our experiments and models indicate that more than 10(-4) of the cells in
CRISPR-Cas positive populations are defective or deleted for the CRISPR-Cas
region and thereby able to receive and carry the plasmid. Most intriguingly, the 
loss of CRISPR function even by large deletions can have little or no fitness
cost in vitro. These theoretical and experimental results can account for the
considerable variation in the existence, number and function of CRISPR-Cas loci
within and between bacterial species. We postulate that as a consequence of the
opposing positive and negative selection for immunity, CRISPR-Cas systems are in 
a continuous state of flux. They are lost when they bear immunity to laterally
transferred beneficial genes, re-acquired by horizontal gene transfer, and ascend
in environments where phage are a major source of mortality.},

    ABSTRACT = {The CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,
CRISPR-associated genes) is an adaptive immunity system in bacteria and archaea
that functions via a distinct self-non-self recognition mechanism that is
partially analogous to the mechanism of eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). The
CRISPR-Cas system incorporates fragments of virus or plasmid DNA into the CRISPR 
repeat cassettes and employs the processed transcripts of these spacers as guide 
RNAs to cleave the cognate foreign DNA or RNA. The Cas proteins, however, are not
homologous to the proteins involved in RNAi and comprise numerous, highly
diverged families. The majority of the Cas proteins contain diverse variants of
the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespread RNA-binding domain. Despite the
fast evolution that is typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions
of the RRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution 
of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several
proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes
encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that
typically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with
CRISPR-Cas systems include the essential Cas2 protein, proteins of COG1517 that, 
in addition to a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically
contain different nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. The
tight association of the CRISPR-Cas immunity systems with predicted toxins that, 
upon activation, would induce dormancy or cell death suggests that adaptive
immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled. Such coupling
could manifest in the persistence state being induced and potentially providing
conditions for more effective action of the immune system or in cell death being 
triggered when immunity fails.},

    ABSTRACT = {Acquisition of foreign DNA can be of advantage or disadvantage to the host cell. 
New DNAs can increase the fitness of an organism to certain environmental
conditions; however, replication and maintenance of incorporated nucleotide
sequences can be a burden for the host cell. These circumstances have resulted in
the development of certain cellular mechanisms limiting horizontal gene transfer,
including the immune system of vertebrates or RNA interference mechanisms in
eukaryotes. Also, in prokaryotes, specific systems have been characterized, which
are aimed especially at limiting the invasion of bacteriophage DNA, for example, 
adsorption inhibition, injection blocking, restriction/modification, or abortive 
infection. Quite recently, another distinct mechanism limiting horizontal
transfer of genetic elements has been identified in procaryotes and shown to
protect microbial cells against exogenous nucleic acids of phage or plasmid
origin. This system has been termed CRISPR/cas and consists of two main
components: (i) the CRISPR (clustered, regularly interspaced short palindromic
regions) locus and (ii) cas genes, encoding CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins. In 
simplest words, the mechanism of CRISPR/cas activity is based on the active
integration of small fragments (proto-spacers) of the invading DNAs (phage or
plasmids) into microbial genomes, which are subsequently transcribed into short
RNAs that direct the degradation of foreign invading DNA elements. In this way,
the host organism acquires immunity toward mobile elements carrying matching
sequences. The CRISPR/cas system is regarded as one of the earliest defense
system that has evolved in prokaryotic organisms. It is inheritable, but at the
same time is unstable when regarding the evolutionary scale. Comparative sequence
analyses indicate that CRISPR/cas systems play an important role in the evolution
of microbial genomes and their predators, bacteriophages.},

prokaryotes. Our lab recently identified the first examples of phage-borne
anti-CRISPR genes that encode protein inhibitors of the type I-F CRISPR-Cas
system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A key question arising from this work was
whether there are other types of anti-CRISPR genes. In the current work, we
address this question by demonstrating that some of the same phages carrying type
I-F anti-CRISPR genes also possess genes that mediate inhibition of the type I-E 
CRISPR-Cas system of P. aeruginosa. We have discovered four distinct families of 
these type I-E anti-CRISPR genes. These genes do not inhibit the type I-F
CRISPR-Cas system of P. aeruginosa or the type I-E system of Escherichia coli.
Type I-E and I-F anti-CRISPR genes are located at the same position in the
genomes of a large group of related P. aeruginosa phages, yet they are found in a
variety of combinations and arrangements. We have also identified functional
anti-CRISPR genes within nonprophage Pseudomonas genomic regions that are likely 
mobile genetic elements. This work emphasizes the potential importance of
anti-CRISPR genes in phage evolution and lateral gene transfer and supports the
hypothesis that more undiscovered families of anti-CRISPR genes exist. Finally,
we provide the first demonstration that the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system of P.
aeruginosa is naturally active without genetic manipulation, which contrasts with
E. coli and other previously characterized I-E systems. IMPORTANCE The CRISPR-Cas
system is an adaptive immune system possessed by the majority of prokaryotic
organisms to combat potentially harmful foreign genetic elements. This study
reports the discovery of bacteriophage-encoded anti-CRISPR genes that mediate
inhibition of a well-studied subtype of CRISPR-Cas system. The four families of
anti-CRISPR genes described here, which comprise only the second group of
anti-CRISPR genes to be identified, encode small proteins that bear no sequence
similarity to previously studied phage or bacterial proteins. Anti-CRISPR genes
represent a newly discovered and intriguing facet of the ongoing evolutionary

    ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: The CRISPR-Cas systems of adaptive antivirus immunity are present in 
most archaea and many bacteria, and provide resistance to specific viruses or
plasmids by inserting fragments of foreign DNA into the host genome and then
utilizing transcripts of these spacers to inactivate the cognate foreign genome. 
The recent development of powerful genome engineering tools on the basis of
CRISPR-Cas has sharply increased the interest in the diversity and evolution of
these systems. Comparative genomic data indicate that during evolution of
prokaryotes CRISPR-Cas loci are lost and acquired via horizontal gene transfer at
high rates. Mathematical modeling and initial experimental studies of
CRISPR-carrying microbes and viruses reveal complex coevolutionary dynamics.
RESULTS: We performed a bifurcation analysis of models of coevolution of viruses 
and microbial host that possess CRISPR-Cas hereditary adaptive immunity systems. 
The analyzed Malthusian and logistic models display complex, and in particular,
quasi-chaotic oscillation regimes that have not been previously observed
experimentally or in agent-based models of the CRISPR-mediated immunity. The key 
factors for the appearance of the quasi-chaotic oscillations are the non-linear
dependence of the host immunity on the virus load and the partitioning of the
hosts into the immune and susceptible populations, so that the system consists of
three components. CONCLUSIONS: Bifurcation analysis of CRISPR-host coevolution
model predicts complex regimes including quasi-chaotic oscillations. The
quasi-chaotic regimes of virus-host coevolution are likely to be biologically
relevant given the evolutionary instability of the CRISPR-Cas loci revealed by
comparative genomics. The results of this analysis might have implications beyond
the CRISPR-Cas systems, i.e. could describe the behavior of any adaptive immunity
system with a heritable component, be it genetic or epigenetic. These predictions
are experimentally testable. REVIEWERS' REPORTS: This manuscript was reviewed by

unique mechanism which involves incorporation of foreign DNA fragments into
CRISPR arrays and subsequent utilization of transcripts of these inserts (known
as spacers) as guide RNAs to cleave the cognate selfish element genome. Multiple 
attempts have been undertaken to explore the coevolution of viruses and microbial
hosts carrying CRISPR-Cas using mathematical models that employ either systems of
differential equations or an agent-based approach, or combinations thereof.
Analysis of these models reveals highly complex co-evolutionary dynamics that
ensues from the combination of the heritability of the CRISPR-mediated adaptive
immunity with the existence of different degrees of immunity depending on the
number of cognate spacers and the cost of carrying a CRISPR-Cas locus. Depending 
on the details of the models, a variety of testable, sometimes conflicting
predictions have been made on the dependence of the degree of immunity and the
benefit of maintaining CRISPR-Cas on the abundance and diversity of hosts and
viruses. Some of these predictions have already been directly validated
experimentally. In particular, both the reality of the virus-host arms race, with
viruses escaping resistance and hosts reacquiring it through the capture of new
spacers, and the fitness cost of CRISPR-Cas due to the curtailment of beneficial 
HGT have been reproduced in the laboratory. However, to test the predictions of
the models more specifically, detailed studies of coevolving populations of
microbes and viruses both in nature and in the laboratory are essential. Such
analyses are expected to yield disagreements with the predictions of the current,
oversimplified models and to trigger a new round of theoretical developments.},

    ABSTRACT = {Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the most common and
dominant bloom-forming
cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes around the world. Microcystis cells
can produce
toxic secondary metabolites, such as microcystins, which are harmful
to human
health. Two M. aeruginosa strains were isolated from two highly
eutrophic lakes
in China and their genomes were sequenced. Comparative genomic
analysis was
performed with the 12 other available M. aeruginosa genomes and
closely related
unicellular cyanobacterium. Each genome of M. aeruginosa containing at
least one 
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)
locus and total
71 loci were identified, suggesting it is ubiquitous in M. aeruginosa
genomes. In
addition to the previously reported subtype I-D cas gene sets, three
CAS subtypes
I-A, III-A and III-B were identified and characterized in this study.
Seven types
of CRISPR direct repeat have close association with CAS subtype,
confirming that 
different and specific secondary structures of CRISPR repeats are
important for
the recognition, binding and process of corresponding cas gene sets.
Homology
search of the CRISPR spacer sequences provides a history of not only
resistance
to bacteriophages and plasmids known to be associated with M.
aeruginosa, but
also the ability to target much more exogenous genetic material in the
natural
environment. These adaptive and heritable defense mechanisms play a
vital role in
keeping genomic stability and self-maintenance by restriction of
horizontal gene 
transfer. Maintaining genomic stability and modulating genomic
plasticity are
both important evolutionary strategies for M. aeruginosa in adaptation
and
survival in various habitats.},

evolution},
year = {2015}, 
doi = {10.1093/gbe/evv113}, 
abstract ={CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats) is a microbial immune system against foreign DNA. Recognition
sequences (spacers) encoded within the CRISPR array mediate the immune
reaction in a sequence-specific manner. The known mechanisms for the
evolution of CRISPR arrays include spacer acquisition from foreign DNA
elements at the time of invasion and array erosion through spacer
deletion. Here we consider the contribution of genetic recombination
between homologous CRISPR arrays to the evolution of spacer
repertoire. Acquisition of spacers from exogenic arrays via
recombination may confer the recipient with immunity against
unencountered antagonists. For this purpose we develop a novel method
for the detection of recombination in CRISPR arrays by modeling the
spacer order in arrays from multiple strains from the same species.
Because the evolutionary signal of spacer recombination may be similar
to that of pervasive spacer deletions or independent spacer
acquisition, our method entails a robustness analysis of the
recombination inference by a statistical comparison to resampled and
perturbed datasets. We analyze CRISPR datasets from four bacterial
species: two Gammaproteobacteria species harboring CRISPR type I and
two Streptococcus species harboring CRISPR type II loci. We find that
CRISPR array evolution in E. coli and S. agalactiae can be explained
solely by vertical inheritance and differential spacer deletion. In P.
aeruginosa, we find an excess of single spacers potentially
incorporated into the CRISPR locus during independent acquisition
events. In S. thermophilus, evidence for spacer acquisition by
recombination is present in five out of 70 strains. Genetic
recombination has been proposed to accelerate adaptation by combining
beneficial mutations that arose in independent lineages. However, for
most species under study, we find that CRISPR evolution is shaped
mainly by spacer acquisition and loss rather than recombination. Since
the evolution of spacer content is characterized by a rapid turnover,
it is likely that recombination is not beneficial for improving phage
resistance in the strains under study, or that it cannot be detected
in the resolution of intra-species comparisons.},

lethal to
wild-type cells and resulted in a reduction of up to 2.5-log in the

between the flanking insertion-sequence elements, all resulting in
elimination of
the Lac-encoding island. Chimeric insertion sequence footprints were
observed at

(CRISPR-associated proteins) is a prokaryotic adaptive immune system
that is
represented in most archaea and many bacteria. Among the currently
known
prokaryotic defense systems, the CRISPR-Cas genomic loci show
unprecedented
complexity and diversity. Classification of CRISPR-Cas variants that
would
capture their evolutionary relationships to the maximum possible
extent is
essential for comparative genomic and functional characterization of
this
theoretically and practically important system of adaptive immunity.
To this end,
a multipronged approach has been developed that combines phylogenetic
analysis of
the conserved Cas proteins with comparison of gene repertoires and
arrangements
in CRISPR-Cas loci. This approach led to the current classification of
CRISPR-Cas
systems into three distinct types and ten subtypes for each of which
signature
genes have been identified. Comparative genomic analysis of the
CRISPR-Cas
systems in new archaeal and bacterial genomes performed over the 3
years elapsed 
since the development of this classification makes it clear that new
types and
subtypes of CRISPR-Cas need to be introduced. Moreover, this
classification
system captures only part of the complexity of CRISPR-Cas organization
and
evolution, due to the intrinsic modularity and evolutionary mobility
of these
immunity systems, resulting in numerous recombinant variants.
Moreover, most of
the cas genes evolve rapidly, complicating the family assignment for
many Cas
proteins and the use of family profiles for the recognition of
CRISPR-Cas subtype
signatures. Further progress in the comparative analysis of CRISPR-Cas
systems
requires integration of the most sensitive sequence comparison tools,
protein
structure comparison, and refined approaches for comparison of gene
neighborhoods.},

    ABSTRACT = {Many bacteria rely on CRISPR-Cas systems to provide
adaptive immunity against
phages, predation by which can shape the ecology and functioning of
microbial
communities. To characterize the impact of CRISPR immunization on
phage genome
evolution, we performed long-term bacterium-phage (Streptococcus
thermophilus-phage 2972) coevolution experiments. We found that in
this species, 
CRISPR immunity drives fixation of single nucleotide polymorphisms
that
accumulate exclusively in phage genome regions targeted by CRISPR.
Mutation rates
in phage genomes highly exceed those of the host. The presence of
multiple phages
increased phage persistence by enabling recombination-based formation
of chimeric
phage genomes in which sequences heavily targeted by CRISPR were
replaced.
Collectively, our results establish CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity as a
key driver 
of phage genome evolution under the conditions studied and highlight
the
importance of multiple coexisting phages for persistence in natural
systems.
IMPORTANCE: Phages remain an enigmatic part of the biosphere. As
predators, they 
challenge the survival of host bacteria and archaea and set off an
"arms race"
involving host immunization countered by phage mutation. The
CRISPR-Cas system is
adaptive: by capturing fragments of a phage genome upon exposure, the
host is
positioned to counteract future infections. To investigate this
process, we
initiated massive deep-sequencing experiments with a host and
infective phage and
tracked the coevolution of both populations over hundreds of days. In
the present
study, we found that CRISPR immunity drives the accumulation of phage
genome
rearrangements (which enable longer phage survival) and escape
mutations,
establishing CRISPR as one of the fundamental drivers of phage
evolution.},

    ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: The success of Enterococcus faecium and E.
faecalis evolving as
multi-resistant nosocomial pathogens is associated with their ability
to acquire 
and share adaptive traits, including antimicrobial resistance genes
encoded by
mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Here, we investigate this mobilome in
successful 
hospital associated genetic lineages, E. faecium sequence type (ST)17
(n=10) and 
ST78 (n=10), E. faecalis ST6 (n=10) and ST40 (n=10) by DNA microarray
analyses.
RESULTS: The hybridization patterns of 272 representative targets
including
plasmid backbones (n=85), transposable elements (n=85), resistance
determinants
(n=67), prophages (n=29) and clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic
repeats (CRISPR)-cas sequences (n=6) separated the strains according
to species, 
and for E. faecalis also according to STs. RCR-, Rep_3-, RepA_N- and
Inc18-family
plasmids were highly prevalent and with the exception of Rep_3, evenly
distributed between the species. There was a considerable difference
in the
replicon profile, with rep 17/pRUM , rep 2/pRE25 , rep 14/EFNP1 and
rep 20/pLG1
dominating in E. faecium and rep 9/pCF10 , rep 2/pRE25 and rep 7 in E.
faecalis
strains. We observed an overall high correlation between the presence
and absence
of genes coding for resistance towards antibiotics, metals, biocides
and their
corresponding MGEs as well as their phenotypic antimicrobial
susceptibility
pattern. Although most IS families were represented in both E.
faecalis and E.
faecium, specific IS elements within these families were distributed
in only one 
species. The prevalence of IS256-, IS3-, ISL3-, IS200/IS605-, IS110-,
IS982- and 
IS4-transposases was significantly higher in E. faecium than E.
faecalis, and
that of IS110-, IS982- and IS1182-transposases in E. faecalis ST6
compared to
ST40. Notably, the transposases of IS981, ISEfm1 and IS1678 that have
only been
reported in few enterococcal isolates were well represented in the E.
faecium
strains. E. faecalis ST40 strains harboured possible functional
CRISPR-Cas
systems, and still resistance and prophage sequences were generally
well
represented. CONCLUSIONS: The targeted MGEs were highly prevalent
among the
selected STs, underlining their potential importance in the evolution
of
hospital-adapted lineages of enterococci. Although the propensity of
inter-species horizontal gene transfer (HGT) must be emphasized, the
considerable
species-specificity of these MGEs indicates a separate vertical
evolution of MGEs
within each species, and for E. faecalis within each ST.},

    ABSTRACT = {In the face of infectious disease, organisms evolved a
range of defense
mechanisms, with a clear distinction between those that are
constitutive (always 
active) and those that are inducible (elicited by parasites). Both
defense
strategies have evolved from each other, but we lack an understanding
of the
conditions that favor one strategy over the other. While it is hard to
generalize
about their degree of protection, it is possible to make
generalizations about
their associated fitness costs, which are commonly detected. By
definition,
constitutive defenses are always "on," and are therefore associated
with a fixed 
cost, independent of parasite exposure. Inducible defenses, on the
other hand,
may lack costs in the absence of parasites but become costly when
defense is
elicited through processes such as immunopathology. Bacteria can
evolve
constitutive defense against phage by modification/masking of surface
receptors, 
which is often associated with reduced fitness in the absence of
phage. Bacteria 
can also evolve inducible defense using the CRISPR-Cas (clustered
regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeat, CRISPR associated) immune
system, which is 
typically elicited upon infection. CRISPR-Cas functions by integrating
phage
sequences into CRISPR loci on the host genome. Upon re-infection,
CRISPR
transcripts guide cleavage of phage genomes. In nature, both
mechanisms are
important. Using a general theoretical model and experimental
evolution, we tease
apart the mechanism that drives their evolution and show that
infection risk
determines the relative investment in the two arms of defense.},
