\maketitle

\section*{Last Week}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wrote Literature Review
    \item Found genera/genomes for the 'mixed' networks (genera with CRISPR and Non-CRISPR genomes)
    \item Tested out HiDe, ran into error with lua
\end{itemize}

\section*{This Week}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the Non-CRISPR genera (genera where all known genomes do not have CRISPR)
    \item Email HiDe author about error, other HGT inference tool he wrote
    \item Investigate some other HGT inference tools in the mean time
    \item Start running all vs all diamond for some of the mixed genera I identified
    \item Pick tree building program
    \item Extract info from other CRISPR annotation set, gives info on subtype, counts, false counts \url{http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/CRISPRone/}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Next Weel}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Have every all vs. all diamond run/running/scheduled
    \item Fix HiDe lua error OR identify another HGT inference method
    \item Review/reorganize genefamily, P/A matrix building scripts and write up specifically in docs
\end{itemize}
