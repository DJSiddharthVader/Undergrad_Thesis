- Desulfitobacterium
  - no networks produced, probably because only 4 taxa in the trees?
- Borreliella
  - deleted plasmid headers from  genome/GCF_000222835.1_ASM22283v1_genomic.fna so parsnp would build the species tree
  - no non-crispr nodes so markophylo/network data missing
- Photobacterium
  - deleted plasmid headers from ./genome/GCF_002356235.1_ASM235623v1_genomic.fna so parsnp would build the species tree

# Supplementary Table
For each genus list
- total number of OTUs
- number of crispr/non-crispr OTUs (from stat report)
- LCBs used in species tree (ls species_tree_WGS/nexus)
- gene trees created (len network_files/all_newick_trees)
- if markophylo data was generated
- 16S tree created?
