\section{Objectives}
The null hypothesis is that bacterial strains/genera with known \ac{crsp} systems will show no significant differences in network statistics to those strains/genera without known \ac{crsp} systems.
Ultimately the goal of this project is to examine the relationship of \ac{hgt} rates and the presence of \ac{crspc} systems, using a network theoretic approach.
\paragraph*{Within Network Comparisons}%2 sentences
For genera with strains containing \ac{crsp} and Non-\ac{crsp} species, comparing the network dynamics of those sets of nodes across genera will elucidate if \ac{crspc} systems affect the \ac{hgt} rates or the association patterns of individual \ac{otu}s.
\paragraph*{Gene Indel Rates Vs. Network Statistics}%2 sentences
Comparing insertion and  deletion rates independantly can help further specify what mechanisms may be responsible for trends observed in network statistics.
If a mixed network is found to be density connected, but also shows a deletion bias, this may imply that most of the genes being transferred may not confer a fitness advantage.
