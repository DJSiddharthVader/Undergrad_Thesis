\section*{\huge Significance \& Future Work}
The results of this work will hopefully shed light on how \ac{crspc} systems affect the rate of \ac{hgt}.
This can help identify new potential strategies for combating the spread of antibiotic resistance.
This study may also shed light on the fitness effects of \ac{crspc} systems and how they manifest at a population level.\par
There are multiple ways to expand this analysis to answer other questions related to the transfer of genes.
As \ac{hgt} inference methods improve and it becomes possible to discern the direction of transfer with confidence, a whole new set of techniques become available for study.
If one is interested in studying the transfer patterns of a specific grouping of genes, either by function, common structural motifs, sequence composition, expression pattern this type of analysis is highly suitable.
For example, the transfer of CRISPR systems themselves is something largely unstudied.
Networks can be constructed from Cas and Cfp1 genes as well as identified \ac{crsp} arrays to estimate how often \ac{crspc} systems themselves move around communities.
Networks constructed from ribosomal genes can be used as a reference point for what very little transfer looks like.
This pipeline provides a simple way to analyze trends \ac{hgt} between a set of specified organisms.
