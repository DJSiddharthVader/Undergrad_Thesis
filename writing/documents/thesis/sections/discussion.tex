\subsection{Limitations}
Some factors that may have introduced bias or error into this analysis:
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Ignored Singletons}: Genes that did not cluster into any families were ingnored from future steps, but may have still represented horiznotally transferred genes
        \item \textbf{Ignored Some Gene Families}: For time considerations, only 1500 gene trees were generated for each genus
        \item \textbf{Signifigance Testing}: Samples are not necessairily independant in a network, further node statistics can only be tested for genera with $> 20$ \ac{crsp} and non-\ac{crsp} \ac{otu}s.
        \item \textbf{Taxonomic Mistakes}: Inconsistencies in taxonomic labelling can result in ignored or misplaced \ac{otu}s.
        \item \textbf{Multifurcation Error}: Some species trees contained multifurcations, which were resolved randomly to generate a bifurcating tree. Estimating this error by examining variance over different resolutions is possible.
\end{itemize}
