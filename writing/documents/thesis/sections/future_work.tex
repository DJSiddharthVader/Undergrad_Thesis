\section*{\huge Future Work}
There are multiple ways to expand this analysis to answer other questions related to the transfer of genes.
As \ac{hgt} inference methods improve and it becomes possible to discern the direction of transfer with confidence, a whole new set of techniques become available for study.
If one is interested in studying the transfer patterns of a specific grouping of genes, either by function, common structural motifs, sequence composition, expression pattern this type of analysis is highly suitable.
For example, the transfer of CRISPR systems themselves is something largely unstudied.
Networks can be constructed from Cas and Cfp1 genes as well as identified \ac{crsp} arrays to estimate how often \ac{crspc} systems themselves move around communities.
Networks constructed from ribosomal genes can be used as a reference point for what very little transfer looks like.
This pipeline provides a simple way to analyze trends \ac{hgt} between a set of specified organisms.
